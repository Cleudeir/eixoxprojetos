## Summary

This project comprises several files related to a React-based website for Eixo X Projetos, an architectural design firm.  The `index.html` file serves as the entry point, loading a React application.  `asset-manifest.json` maps hashed filenames to their logical counterparts, crucial for caching and versioning.  `manifest.json` configures the website as a Progressive Web App (PWA).  `robots.txt` manages web crawler access. `main.c360b759.js` bundles React, React DOM, React JSX Runtime, React Scheduler, and JSS.  `main.855c08fd.js` is the main application file, using React, Material-UI, React Router, and JSS for styling and routing. It features sections for a project portfolio (images, 360Â° views, YouTube videos), a header, and a footer.  The project employs a build process involving minification and hashing for optimization.  The license information is contained within separate `.LICENSE.txt` files.
